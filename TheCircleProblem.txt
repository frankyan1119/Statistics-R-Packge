# The Circle Problem: A robot fires a pistol at a square wall (2m x 2m). 
# A circular target is precisely in the center and centered on the #middle of the square. 
# It has radius 1m. The robot fires each shot independently of the last and is equally likely to hit any point on the #wall. 
# What is the probability that it hits the circle?

#Code:
Circle = function(n){ #n is the number of shots fired
	hits = 0 #shots that hit the circle, initial is 0
	for (i in 1:n) {
		x = runif(1,-1,1) #radius of 1
		y = runif(1,-1,1)
		hits = hits + (x^2+y^2 <= 1) #recall for boolean values: true = 1, false = 0
	}
	prob = return(hits/n) #calculating the probability
	return(prob)
}

#Example:
n=5000

Circle(n)

#[1] 0.7912
